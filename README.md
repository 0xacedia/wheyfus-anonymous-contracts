Ok pls allow me to take u through a tour of the contracts.

```
forge install
forge test
```

Here's how it works:

* Step 1: You mint some wheyfu's
* Step 2: Take equal parts wheyfus and eth and LP them into a shared sudoswap pool.
* Step 3: Receive some LP tokens representing your share in the pool.

* Step 4a: Take those LP tokens and bond them for a fixed term in option bonds.
* Step 5a: At bond maturity, claim back your LP tokens + call option tokens for *MOARRR* wheyfus.
* Step 6a: Convert those call option tokens into actual call options via putty.
* Step 7a: Exercise the call options.
* Step 8a: With your new wheyfus you can then go back to step 2.

* Step 4b: Take those LP tokens and bond them for a fixed term in xyk pool fee bonds.
* Step 5b: At bond maturity, claim back your LP tokens + fees generated from the shared xyk sudo pool.
* Step 6b: With ur new eth go back to step 2.

\*blows kiss\* <sup>*teehee*</sup>

NB:
* The longer you bond, the higher your relative yield boost.
* Each option expires in 5 years and has a strike of N wheyfus * 0.1 ether.
* 18000 wheyfus in the form of option contracts are distributed over 900 days.
